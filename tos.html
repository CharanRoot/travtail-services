<h2>Job Pricing</h2>
<p> You agree that you will communicate any concerns you have about the price of the job to the customer before you accept the job - once you accept the job, you are liable for making sure it is completed at the specific date and time. The price for each service request does not the cost include materials. Hourly rate only.
</p>
<h2>Bidding for Jobs</h2>
<p> You agree that your bid is your “good faith” estimate of the price it will take to complete a service request. If you are selected for the job, the customer does will not be liable for any cost overruns. If you believe the job requires additional materials, chat with the customer to agree on the cost of the materials or any other additional cost before accepting the job – the customer can increase the price of the job so that includes the cost of the materials.
</p>
<h2>Accepting Payments</h2>
<p> Apart from cash tips, you agree to not accept payment outside of Travtail. The customer is not obligated to give you tips. The customer can increase the price of the job so that it includes tips before you mark the job as completed. Once the job is completed, the price cannot be changed.
</p>
<h2>Requesting for Services via Alexa</h2>
<p> Alexa can only be used for jobs that are very urgent and don’t need bidding. Alexa jobs are based on pricing range that we have specified on our <a href="https://travtail.app/pricing" target="_blank">pricing page</a>.
</p>
<h2>Canceling a Job</h2>
<p> You can cancel a job before a service provider accepts it or you select a service provider from a bid request. If you cancel a job while it is ongoing, you will be charged 50% of the job’s cost. Instead of canceling your job, we recommend you contact the service provider to reschedule a time that works for you. You will not be charged until the job is completed. <br> If you cancel an in-progress job as a service provider, you will be removed from our platform after 3 cancelations.
